## Installation

```bash
pip install RealtimeTTS
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies, including a **CPU support only** version of PyTorch (needed for Coqui engine)

To use Coqui engine it is recommended to upgrade torch to GPU usage (see installation steps under [Coqui Engine](#coquiengine) further below).

## Engine Requirements

Different engines supported by RealtimeTTS have unique requirements. Ensure you fulfill these requirements based on the engine you choose.

### SystemEngine
The `SystemEngine` works out of the box using your system's built-in TTS capabilities. No additional setup is needed.

### AzureEngine
To use the `AzureEngine`, you will need:
- Microsoft Azure Text-to-Speech API key (provided via AzureEngine constructor parameter "speech_key" or in the environment variable AZURE_SPEECH_KEY)
- Microsoft Azure service region.

Make sure you have these credentials available and correctly configured when initializing the `AzureEngine`.

### ElevenlabsEngine
For the `ElevenlabsEngine`, you need:
- Elevenlabs API key (provided via ElevenlabsEngine constructor parameter "api_key" or in the environment variable ELEVENLABS_API_KEY)
- `mpv` installed on your system (essential for streaming mpeg audio, Elevenlabs only delivers mpeg).

  ðŸ”¹ **Installing `mpv`:**
  - **macOS**:
    ```bash
    brew install mpv
    ```

  - **Linux and Windows**: Visit [mpv.io](https://mpv.io/) for installation instructions.

### CoquiEngine

Delivers high quality, local, neural TTS with voice-cloning.  

Downloads a neural TTS model first. In most cases it be fast enought for Realtime using GPU synthesis. Needs around 4-5 GB VRAM.

- To use voice cloning create a 24000 Hz mono 16bit WAV file containing a short (~10 sec) sample of the voice to clone, then submit the filename as cloning_reference_wav to the CoquiEngine constructor.

#### GPU-Support (CUDA) for Coqui

Additional steps are needed for a **GPU-optimized** installation. These steps are recommended for those who require **better performance** and have a compatible NVIDIA GPU.

> **Note**: *To check if your NVIDIA GPU supports CUDA, visit the [official CUDA GPUs list](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).*

    If you run into library compatility issues, please set these libraries to fixed versions:

    ```bash
    pip install networkx==2.8.8
    pip install typing_extensions==4.8.0

    pip install numpy==1.24.3
    pip install requests==2.31.0
    ```

## Quick Start

Here's a basic usage example:

```python
from RealtimeTTS import TextToAudioStream, SystemEngine, AzureEngine, ElevenlabsEngine

engine = SystemEngine() # replace with your TTS engine
stream = TextToAudioStream(engine)
stream.feed("Hello world! How are you today?")
stream.play_async()
```

## Feed Text

You can feed individual strings:

```python
stream.feed("Hello, this is a sentence.")
```

Or you can feed generators and character iterators for real-time streaming:

```python
def write(prompt: str):
    for chunk in openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content" : prompt}],
        stream=True
    ):
        if (text_chunk := chunk["choices"][0]["delta"].get("content")) is not None:
            yield text_chunk

text_stream = write("A three-sentence relaxing speech.")

stream.feed(text_stream)
```

```python
char_iterator = iter("Streaming this character by character.")
stream.feed(char_iterator)
```

## Playback

Asynchronously:

```python
stream.play_async()
while stream.is_playing():
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

Synchronously:

```python
stream.play()
```

## Configuration

### Initialization Parameters for `TextToAudioStream`

When you initialize the `TextToAudioStream` class, you have various options to customize its behavior. Here are the available parameters:

#### `engine` (BaseEngine)
- **Type**: BaseEngine
- **Required**: Yes
- **Description**: The underlying engine responsible for text-to-audio synthesis. You must provide an instance of `BaseEngine` or its subclass to enable audio synthesis.

#### `on_text_stream_start` (callable)
- **Type**: Callable function
- **Required**: No
- **Description**: This optional callback function is triggered when the text stream begins. Use it for any setup or logging you may need.

#### `on_text_stream_stop` (callable)
- **Type**: Callable function
- **Required**: No
- **Description**: This optional callback function is activated when the text stream ends. You can use this for cleanup tasks or logging.

#### `on_audio_stream_start` (callable)
- **Type**: Callable function
- **Required**: No
- **Description**: This optional callback function is invoked when the audio stream starts. Useful for UI updates or event logging.

#### `on_audio_stream_stop` (callable)
- **Type**: Callable function
- **Required**: No
- **Description**: This optional callback function is called when the audio stream stops. Ideal for resource cleanup or post-processing tasks.

#### `on_character` (callable)
- **Type**: Callable function
- **Required**: No
- **Description**: This optional callback function is called when a single character is processed.

#### `level` (int)
- **Type**: Integer
- **Required**: No
- **Default**: `logging.WARNING`
- **Description**: Sets the logging level for the internal logger. This can be any integer constant from Python's built-in `logging` module.

#### Example Usage:

```python
engine = YourEngine()  # Substitute with your engine
stream = TextToAudioStream(
    engine=engine,
    on_text_stream_start=my_text_start_func,
    on_text_stream_stop=my_text_stop_func,
    on_audio_stream_start=my_audio_start_func,
    on_audio_stream_stop=my_audio_stop_func,
    level=logging.INFO
)
```

### Methods

#### `play` and `play_async`

These methods are responsible for executing the text-to-audio synthesis and playing the audio stream. The difference is that `play` is a blocking function, while `play_async` runs in a separate thread, allowing other operations to proceed.

##### `fast_sentence_fragment` (bool)
- **Default**: `False`
- **Description**: When set to `True`, the method will prioritize speed, generating and playing sentence fragments faster. This is useful for applications where latency matters.

##### `buffer_threshold_seconds` (float)
- **Default**: `2.0`
- **Description**: Specifies the time in seconds for the buffering threshold, which impacts the smoothness and continuity of audio playback. 

  - **How it Works**: Before synthesizing a new sentence, the system checks if there is more audio material left in the buffer than the time specified by `buffer_threshold_seconds`. If so, it retrieves another sentence from the text generator, assuming that it can fetch and synthesize this new sentence within the time window provided by the remaining audio in the buffer. This process allows the text-to-speech engine to have more context for better synthesis, enhancing the user experience.

  A higher value ensures that there's more pre-buffered audio, reducing the likelihood of silence or gaps during playback. If you experience breaks or pauses, consider increasing this value.

- **Hint**: If you experience silence or breaks between sentences, consider raising this value to ensure smoother playback.

##### `minimum_sentence_length` (int)
- **Default**: `3`
- **Description**: Sets the minimum character length to consider a string as a sentence to be synthesized. This affects how text chunks are processed and played.

##### `log_characters` (bool)
- **Default**: `False`
- **Description**: Enable this to log the individual characters that are being processed for synthesis.

##### `log_synthesized_text` (bool)
- **Default**: `False`
- **Description**: When enabled, logs the text chunks as they are synthesized into audio. Helpful for auditing and debugging.

By understanding and setting these parameters and methods appropriately, you can tailor the `TextToAudioStream` to meet the specific needs of your application.
