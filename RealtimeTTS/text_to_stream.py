        Initializes the TextToAudioStream.

        Args:
            engine (Union[BaseEngine, List[BaseEngine]]):
                The engine or list of engines used for text-to-audio synthesis.
                `BaseEngine` is the interface or base class defining how
                synthesis is performed. Multiple engines can be provided for
                fallbacks.
                
            log_characters (bool, optional):
                Whether to log each character being processed for synthesis.
                Useful for debugging or monitoring character-level processing.
                Defaults to False.
                
            on_text_stream_start (callable, optional):
                A callback function triggered when the text stream begins.
                This can be used to perform setup actions or display status
                updates.

            on_text_stream_stop (callable, optional):
                A callback function triggered when the text stream ends.
                This can be used to clean up resources or indicate that the
                text-to-speech process has completed.

            on_audio_stream_start (callable, optional):
                A callback function triggered when the audio playback begins.
                Useful for tracking the start of the audio output.

            on_audio_stream_stop (callable, optional):
                A callback function triggered when the audio playback stops.
                Useful for cleaning up or updating the UI once playback ends.

            on_character (callable, optional):
                A callback function triggered for every individual character
                processed during synthesis. This can be useful for real-time
                updates, such as visualizing which character is being processed
                or sent for synthesis.

            on_word (callable, optional):
                A callback function triggered when a word is spoken. This can be
                useful for tracking word-level progress or highlighting spoken
                words in a text display.
                Currently only works for AzureEngine and KokoroEngine, since
                the other engines don't provide word-level timings.

            output_device_index (int, optional):
                The index of the audio output device to use for playback.
                If None, the system's default audio output device will be used.
                This index corresponds to the device indices returned by the
                PyAudio interface.

            tokenizer (str, optional):
                Specifies the tokenizer used to split input text into sentences
                or smaller chunks for synthesis. Supported options are:
                - "nltk": Uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) tokenizer.
                - "stanza": Uses the Stanza library for advanced sentence
                  splitting.
                Defaults to "nltk".
                
            language (str, optional):
                Language code (e.g., "en" for English, "de" for German) used for
                sentence splitting and processing. Ensure the tokenizer
                supports the specified language. Defaults to "en".

            muted (bool, optional):
                If True, disables audio playback on local speakers, allowing
                audio data to be processed or saved to a file without being
                played. This is useful for silent synthesis scenarios or batch
                processing. Defaults to False.

            frames_per_buffer (int, optional):
                Determines how many audio frames PyAudio processes in each
                buffer. If set to `pa.paFramesPerBufferUnspecified`, PyAudio
                chooses an appropriate default value. Lower values may reduce
                latency but increase CPU usage. Higher values may reduce CPU
                load but increase latency. Defaults to PyAudioâ€™s unspecified
                setting.

            playout_chunk_size (int, optional):
                The size (in bytes) of audio chunks played to the output stream
                at a time. If set to -1, the chunk size is determined based on
                `frames_per_buffer` or a default internal value. Smaller chunks
                allow for lower latency but require more frequent processing,
                while larger chunks may introduce latency but reduce overhead.
                Defaults to -1.

            level (int, optional):
                The logging level to use for internal logging. Accepts standard
                Python logging levels, such as `logging.DEBUG`, `logging.INFO`,
                `logging.WARNING`, etc. Defaults to `logging.WARNING`.

        Handles the synthesis of text to audio.
        Plays the audio stream and waits until it is finished playing.
        If the engine can't consume generators, it utilizes a player.

        Args:
        - fast_sentence_fragment: Determines if sentence fragments should be quickly yielded. Useful when a faster response is desired even if a sentence isn't complete.
        - fast_sentence_fragment_allsentences: Fast_sentence_fragment only works on the first sentence. Set this to True if you want to work it on every sentence.
        - fast_sentence_fragment_allsentences_multiple: Can yield multiple sentence fragments, not only a single one.
        - buffer_threshold_seconds (float): Time in seconds for the buffering threshold, influencing the flow and continuity of audio playback. Set to 0 to deactivate. Default is 0.
          - How it Works: The system verifies whether there is more audio content in the buffer than the duration defined by buffer_threshold_seconds. If so, it proceeds to synthesize the next sentence, capitalizing on the remaining audio to maintain smooth delivery. A higher value means more audio is pre-buffered, which minimizes pauses during playback. Adjust this upwards if you encounter interruptions.
          - Helps to decide when to generate more audio based on buffered content.
        - minimum_sentence_length (int): The minimum number of characters a sentence must have. If a sentence is shorter, it will be concatenated with the following one, improving the overall readability. This parameter does not apply to the first sentence fragment, which is governed by `minimum_first_fragment_length`. Default is 10 characters.
        - minimum_first_fragment_length (int): The minimum number of characters required for the first sentence fragment before yielding. Default is 10 characters.
        - log_synthesized_text: If True, logs the synthesized text chunks.
        - reset_generated_text: If True, resets the generated text.
        - output_wavfile: If set, saves the audio to the specified WAV file.
        - on_sentence_synthesized: Callback function that gets called after hen a single sentence fragment was synthesized.
        - before_sentence_synthesized: Callback function that gets called before a single sentence fragment gets synthesized.
        - on_audio_chunk: Callback function that gets called when a single audio chunk is ready.
        - tokenizer: Tokenizer to use for sentence splitting (currently "nltk" and "stanza" are supported).
        - tokenize_sentences (Callable): A function that tokenizes sentences from the input text. You can write your own lightweight tokenizer here if you are unhappy with nltk and stanza. Defaults to None. Takes text as string and should return splitted sentences as list of strings.
        - language: Language to use for sentence splitting.
        - context_size: The number of characters used to establish context for sentence boundary detection. A larger context improves the accuracy of detecting sentence boundaries. Default is 12 characters.
        - muted: If True, disables audio playback via local speakers (in case you want to synthesize to file or process audio chunks). Default is False.
        - sentence_fragment_delimiters (str): A string of characters that are
            considered sentence delimiters. Default is ".?!;:,\nâ€¦)]}ã€‚-".
        - force_first_fragment_after_words (int): The number of words after
            which the first sentence fragment is forced to be yielded.
            Default is 30 words.
        - is_external_call: If True, the method is called from an external source.
        - debug: If True, enables debug mode.
